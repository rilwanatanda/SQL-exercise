I noticed that during a lot of dialogue scenes with only two or three people, there will often only be one of the characters in the shot. It gave me the impression that those characters" lines were shot separately and then edited back into the scene, but I"m not sure that that"s actually the reason why they are shot this way. </p>    <p>An example off the top of my head is the scene in Gertrude Stein"s salon when we first meet Adriana, the Marion Cotillard character. She is standing in the doorway of the salon while everyone critiques Picasso"s portrait of her. During her lines, she is the only person in the frame, and if I recall correctly she doesn"t have any off camera lines, either.</p>    <p>You can almost see it in <a href="http://movieclips.com/n3ALF-midnight-in-paris-movie-exceptionally-lovely/">this video</a> but it stops too soon.

The rest of Adriana"s shots in that scene are framed exactly like that first shot of her, close in on her, with no other people in the shot and no movement from the camera. It gives me the impression that she isn"t really a part of the rest of the scene, like we"re cutting to somewhere else when we"re looking at her. </p>    <p>Is this a choice, or were there simply scenes that had to be re-shot later and so they ended up a little funky?

At the end of the movie, Leamas is let out of his cell by Mundt and provided with a car.  Mundt also lets Leamas" lover, Nan, escape with him.  Mundt knows, however, that Leamas is going to tell Nan everything, which is why he has the boy shoot her as she and Leamas are climbing over the wall.  When Leamas sees that Nan has been shot, he decides that he doesn"t want to go on living without her, climbs back to the East German side, and gets shot.</p>    <p>Why was Nan released in the first place, however?  Leamas seems to believe, in his final monologue, that it was part of a deal, and that Mundt believed that he wouldn"t leave without her, a belief that is justified in the last minute of the film.  But it seems to me that Leamas would be more likely to accept life as a Nan-less spy if she was ditched in East Germany than if she was shot by a fellow British agent.  Furthermore, a more convincing argument for his return could have been made by Mundt at the gate than the one Smiley and the boy attempt to make in the last lines of the film.</p>    <p>It would also have been better for Mundt to keep Nan in East Germany, because it makes the escape less suspicious.  The Soviets will easily believe that Fiedler"s co-conspirators helped Leamas escape, because Leamas was working for them and they owed it to him, and the official explanation is that Leamas and Fiedler were working together to incriminate Mundt, so it makes sense that Fiedler"s friends would help him escape.  What makes less sense, however, is Fiedler"s friends helping Nan escape - they owe nothing to her, and Nan was the girl who unraveled their entire plot.  They have no motive for saving her other than that Leamas wants them to, and that motive is non-consequential enough that the story Mundt will provide would make sense without letting Nan go.</p>    <p>So why was Nan let go?

In a somewhat unorthodox fashion, however, many of the original actors/actresses that Andy crossed paths with were called back to assist with the re-creation of those very same scenes. </p>    <p>So, aside from the obvious amount of time that has passed (the actors and actresses clearly all look a bit older) the scenes are more-or-less exact replicas of what happened in Andy"s past. This includes many cameos from the cast of Taxi, wrestler Jerry Lawler, SNL Producer Lorne Michaels, David Letterman and more. There are most certainly some actors that weren"t able to reprise their roles, for various reasons (the scene wasn"t important enough, the original actor wasn"t available/dead/etc), but there was one key actor missing who could have reprised his role--for a very significant scene: Michael Richards, in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_xqiCeIFws">the "Friday"s" incident</a>.</p>    <p>Back in "81, Andy appeared on a live sketch comedy show which attempted to take advantage of the success of Saturday Night Live. It was comprised of young comedians getting their start in the industry, and performing sketches on live TV, much in the same fashion as SNL. On one particular night, a sketch involving four friends (one of which was played by Andy Kaufman, another by Michael Richards) took place at a restaurant, with the joke being that they would get up at various times and head to the bathroom to smoke marijuana. About half-way through this sketch, Kaufman decided for whatever reason to go off script, infuriating and frustrating his fellow cast members. At one point, Richards goes off camera and returns with the sketch"s cue cards, and tosses them on the table in front of Kaufman, at which point Kaufman sprays Richards with a glass of water, causing even more friction, and an eventual fight breaks out between Kaufman and Friday"s co-producer Jack Burns.</p>    <p>Andy was known for unconventional humor. Throughout his career, he made a lot of judgment calls about what he thought was true comedy, but that not very many other people seemed to agree on. One recurring theme in his comedy was that <strong>he liked to keep the audience guessing</strong>. Was what we were seeing really real? Or was it all an elaborate hoax? A staged event that really truly seems like it is actually happening, only to find out later that it was a sham from the start. </p>    <p>Many people that Kaufman staged these "events" with now confirm today that they were, in fact, staged; the most famous of which could be considered the entire series of events that took place between wrestler Jerry Lawler and Kaufman. And, as expected, in the case of the "Friday"s" incident, it was also revealed later that the entire scene...Kaufman going off script, Richards" frustration, the cue-cards, the water splashing and eventual fight...all was a plan from the beginning.

Or was there another reason that kept Richards from participating, other than the most basic guesses of <em>"it was an embarrassment for him"</em>, or <em>"he simply didn"t want to re-live the past"</em>, or even <em>"his schedule simply didn"t allow for him to contribute to the movie"</em> (which seems unlikely). </p>    <p>Is there any proof available to the story that the event, though portrayed after the fact as a hoax, may have truly been, in fact, something that Kaufman came up with on-the-fly, and the network/people involved simply used "oh, it was planned" as a cover for them losing control of Kaufman on live TV--and that the <em>real</em> reason Richards refused to portray himself in that infamous scene was due to the fact that <strong>he knew the truth</strong>...that Kaufman embarrassed Richards and his fellow cast members on live TV without their knowledge, and to this day, will really have nothing to do with any homage paying tribute to Kaufman? </p>', 165, 1199, '2013-07-02 11:43:07.893', '2013-07-02 11:43:07.893', N'Why did Michael Richards refuse to portray himself?', N'<analysis><comedy><cinema-history><man-on-the-moon>', '2012-03-07 20:10:52.817'),

It seems loosely that cast (in order of today"s "big name" significance), directors and financiers get the front spots, and everything else appears later.  But lately I"ve been developing some specific curiosities about how cast members are credited on TV shows.</p>    <p>Opening credits seem to follow this rough outline:</p>    <p>Part of "opening credits" video segment</p>    <ol>  <li>(optional) Major Actors</li>  <li>Show Title</li>  <li>Core Cast Actors</li>  <li>Directors</li>  <li>Producers</li>  <li>(optional) Episode Title</li>  <li>Episode Writers</li>  </ol>    <p>Subtitles over beginning of show, after opening video</p>    <ol>  <li>(Episode Title and Writers may appear here, instead)</li>  <li>Special Guest Actors</li>  </ol>    <p>I"ve probably missed a few things, and mis-ordered a few things.  But, as I said, my main curiosity is about actor credits.</p>    <p>Typically, there is little indication of which characters the core cast actors play.  Sometimes their name is edited to appear along with an image of the character as an indictator, but sometimes there is no indication.  As I"ve never seen anyone credited in both the opening and closing credits, that leaves the potential for core actors to never be directly associated with their character.  This seems potentially problematic; is there a reason for this?  Are viewers expected to know who"s who?</p>    <p>Guest actors sometimes are simply credited by name (and not being part of the opening video, this means they will never be associated with their character in credits).  But often they are credited as "<strong>special guest</strong> as <strong>character name</strong>".  This is quite helpful.</p>    <p>The thing I find really confusing is, sometimes the last few regular cast actors will get the guest actor treatment.  I"ve seen opening video with "and <strong>actor</strong> as <strong>character</strong>" paired with an image of that character for an entire season.  Why does this actor get special treatment?</p>    <p>Finally, sometimes guest actors will be credited at the front following the opening video, sometimes they"ll be credited in the closing credits.  Are there rules for deciding who get"s credited early or late?</p>    <p>I"ve sometimes wondered if shows deliberately play with actor"s name position to obfuscate plot arcs ("you won"t think we"re killing of this character if their actor is still in the opening credits", or "you won"t expect this recurring guest if we place their name in the closing credits") and I"ve also wondered if there are thresholds for "people appearing in XX number or YY percentage of episodes get placed <strong>here</strong>."

Jeff wants to remain together, but <em>not</em> marry.

At the end of each episode, everything that had happened was completely and forgotten, and the show effectively "reset" for the next episode. This included not just the obvious sit-coms, but also dramatic shows like sci-fi, cop shows, etc. I don"t remember any show that stands out as paying the least attention to "continuity".</p>    <p>The only deviation here were soap operas, which were just a bunch of overlapping, long-running storylines woven together, but those seemed to be the exception to the rule, and only a handful showed up on prime time.</p>    <p>By the late 90s it seemed like there was a change, to the point where everything <em>but</em> sit-coms were more serialized. Episodes were still self-contained but also fit together into longer, multi-episode, season-wide or even multi-season story arcs. Things that happened in one episode would be written in to subsequent episodes on a regular basis.</p>    <p>For some reason, the two shows that always stick in my brain when I think about this are <em>Golden Girls</em> (one of the last shows I remember from living at home) vs. <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> (one of the first shows I remember from living on my own.) and how dramatically different those shows treated continuity. These days, most dramatic television seems to make at least some effort to be internally consistent from show to show.</p>    <p>Am I just mis-remembering the kind of TV that was popular up through the 90s? Were there a lot of quality serial-type shows on at that time that I just never saw or have since forgotten? Or was there really a shift in the type of programming that made it to prime time teleivsion, and if so, why did that happen?</p>    <p>(Also, I should point out that I"m specifically not counting things like major cast changes, which would be <em>impossible</em> for a show to ignore, but rather that <em>events</em> that happened in one episode are never brought up again, even when they would be relevant, or that there was no cross-episode plots that linked them together.)</p>    <p>UPATE:</p>    <p>Several comments have pointed out how much riskier serial dramas are than episodic ones from the network"s perspective.

The original was constructed by the CIA, and whichever version ends up at the X Mansion is of unknown origin but was definitely built after the Xavier/Magneto split.</p></li>  <li><p>In X-Men, we wee a different X Mansion from the one that appears in X-Men: First Class. <strong><em>OK, so they moved. I can relate to that :)</em></strong></p></li>  <li><p>In X-Men, Prof X doesn"t seem to remember meeting Wolverine before, though they meet briefly in X-Men: First Class.</p></li>  <li><p>In X-Men: First Class, Emma Frost (White Queen) meets and is an adversary of Charles Xavier. In X-Men Origins: Wolverine, she doesn"t seem to know him and follows him onto a helicopter without comment or complaint. <strong><em>This one might have been answered below.</em></strong></p></li>  <li><p>In X-Men 3: The Last Stand, Prof X and Magneto are seen visiting the home of Jean Grey to recruit her to the school. This scene presumably takes place many years after the end of X-Men: First Class, where we see the rift between Xavier and Magneto has already taken place.</p></li>  <li><p>In X-Men: First Class we see Hank turn into the blue furry Beast as a young man in the year 1963. In X2: X-Men United Dr. Hank McCoy appears in a television interview and he is not blue and furry.</p></li>  </ul>', 1542, 945, '2014-01-26 13:40:29.550', '2014-01-26 13:40:29.550', N'Has the continuity timeline been established for the new X-men movies?', N'<x-men><continuity>', '2013-01-18 16:45:54.140'),

He warns the upcoming SWAT team that the grenade will go off shortly and they run away.</p>    <p>This question states that the policemen didn"t have enough time to escape the explosion. But I for myself always thought they made it out of the explosion radius in time, but then again, I"m not totally sure about this anymore, since this question says they surely didn"t have enough time as judged by the immediate cut to the explosion destroying the building (although I vaguely remember it to only destroy a single floor).</p>    <p>The reason I"m asking this is, that I think the fact of the policemen dying would bring a major inconsistency with the general moral justification of the heroes" actions throughout the movie. There are actually no real human enemies in this movie and the movie more than one time elaborates on the fact, that the heroes (and especially the supposedly good <em>Terminator</em>) don"t kill anyone, in order for the viewer to better identify with them on a moral basis. Whereas the previous movie had that touch of sweet immorality, once you decided that it is <em>cool</em> to watch <em>Arnie</em> run around and kill everybody, this one goes to great lengths to show him as a <em>"good guy"</em>, especially in the scene more or less immediately before the questioned one. And in the end most action movies where the hero kills multiple bad guys in a row still try not to show him directly killing innocents.</p>    <p>So I see different possibilities for this:</p>    <ul>  <li>The SWAT team didn"t die and managed to escape in time.</li>  <li>Their death is to be justified as kind of collateral damage (in line with all the others killed by the <em>T-1000</em>, the "evil <em>Terminator</em>"), since <em>Dyson</em> didn"t kill them completely on purpose.</li>  <li>Their death is merely ignored or justified with a sense of "the end justifies the means" (which IMHO wouldn"t be in line with the movie"s previous moral elaborations, though).</li>  <li>It is left open for the viewer to decide (which in turn was a bit too <em>"heavy"</em> an aspect for such a straight-to-the-point action movie).</li>  </ul>    <p>And my question is, <strong>did the SWAT team die from <em>Miles Dyson</em>"s grenade, and if yes, how is this supposed to be justified?</strong></p>    <p>(disclaimer: Now it might be that this has been intentionally left open for interpretation which would make this a bit of an open discussion question.

It seems entirely plausible Marla Singer materializes to remind Jack he is exploiting these therapy groups. In fact, even when Marla enters she says, "This is cancer, right?" nobody responds.</p>    <p>In addition to the blog, there are three examples of where I can think Marla Singer"s presence is suggested but not required.</p>    <hr>    <p>After Tyler"s confrontation to Marla, he follows her to the laundromat where she removes the clothes from the dryer and proceeds next-door to sell them at a thrift shop. Even though the two are having a conversation in front of the thrift-shop attendant, she does not interject and instead only remains silent with a puzzled look on her face about the talk of bowel cancer. </p>    <p>Does this suggest that overly-civilized and feminized Jack invents Marla, a symbol of his guilt, and steers her toward outlet for his disdain of the order of society? Marla is self-destructive, manipulative, and a kleptomaniac. Whereas later on, Jack invents a hyper-masculine Tyler who is outwardly destructive, blatantly honest and disdains materialism and thus has no need to steal.</p>    <hr>    <p>After Jack"s boss finds some Fight Club paraphernalia on the Xerox machine, Jack says:</p>    <blockquote>    <p>I"d be very careful who I talked to about this.  It sounds like someone dangerous wrote it... someone who might snap at any moment, stalking from office to office with an Armalite AR-10 Carbine-gas semiautomatic, bitterly pumping round after round into colleagues and co-workers. Might be someone you"ve known for years... somebody very close to you. Or, maybe you shouldn"t be bringing me every little piece of trash you pick up.</p>  </blockquote>    <p>Then the phone rings, and it"s Marla. Since we already know Jack invents Tyler as a way for him to cope with his repression from civilization, it seems like picking up the phone and talking to an imaginary person would use the same set of coping skills that led him to invent Tyler. </p>    <hr>    <p>In the diner after not having seen Marla for an extended period of time, she orders food: </p>    <blockquote>    <p>"I"ll have the clam chowder, the fried chicken with the baked potato with everything, and a chocolate chiffon pie."</p>  </blockquote>    <p>If Marla isn"t real, the waiter only responds to Jack"s subsequent request for <em>Clean food, please.</em>, by saying,</p>    <blockquote>    <p>In that case, sir, may I advise against the lady eating the clam chowder?</p>  </blockquote>    <p>We know the clam chowder at any of the restaurants is arguably the most contaminated food item. So, it would be logical for the waiter to recommend not eating clam chowder to anybody requesting clean food.</p>    <p>There are many possibilities as to why the waiter says the "<strong>lady</strong>" but it seems like this is the most damning to the theory of Marla"s non-existence. The waiter may be attempting to allude to the fact that Jack isn"t the same person as he is during Fight Club. But it may not be as bad as it seems at first glance, because the waiter doesn"t use the pronoun <strong>she</strong> or <strong>her</strong>. </p>    <p>It is also acceptable to refer to a high-ranking woman to their face as "<em>the lady</em>".</p>    <p>Since Jack even thought to himself --</p>    <blockquote>    <p>Even if I could tell someone they had a good fight, I wouldn"t be talking to the same man. Who you were in fight club is not who you were in the rest of the world.</p>  </blockquote>    <p>Perhaps this is a play on Jack"s lack of masculinity outside of Fight Club, the same way drill sergeants call their recruits ladies.

It sticks out so starkly, I can"t help but feel that it was intentional, for effect.</p>    <p>When I saw it in theaters, I initially thought it was perhaps an allusion to the "spirit" of Ra"s speaking through Bane, or similarly, that perhaps it was the League of Shadows as a whole -- a legion of spirits speaking through the League of Shadows-"incarnate".</p>    <p>After the movie, when discovering that others hadn"t heard or noticed it, I wondered if it was just coincidental, or perhaps just some fluctuation or mismatch of Bane"s voice processing in post-production.</p>    <p><em>Where it is:</em></p>    <p>In the underground sewer scene, when Bane and Batman are fighting, listen to Bane"s lines right after Batman throws the smoke bombs in front of Bane.</p>    <blockquote>    <p>BANE: "Theatricality and deception, powerful agents to the uninitiated."  </p>        <p>BANE: "...But we are initiated, aren"t we, Bruce?"</p>        <p><strong>BANE (voice change): "<em>Members</em> of the League of Shadows. And you betrayed <em>us</em>."*</strong>  (emphasis mine)</p>        <p>BATMAN: "..."<strong><em>Us</em></strong>"? <strong><em>You</em></strong> were excommunicated... by a gang of psychopaths." (*See EDIT)</p>        <p><strong>BANE: "I am the League of Shadows..."</strong> (switches to normal voice) "And I"m here to fulfill Ra"s Al Ghul"s destiny!"</p>  </blockquote>    <p>++ The YouTube clip is no longer available ++</p>    <p>It sounds so distinct to me, it sounds like a different actor"s voice entirely. </p>    <p>Batman calls out Bane on his "altered"-voice statement where Bane infers that he"s still in full fellowship with the League of Shadows. This could lend credence to Bane actually changing his voice as if it were the League speaking through him, like a legion, or as a spokesperson. </p>    <p>This <em>could</em> be an intentional alteration by Bane himself, or it could perhaps be an "audience-only" subtext or view -- subtly foreshadowing the coming resurgence and "reincarnation" of the League of Shadows through both Ra"s" appearance and Talia"s (eventual) unmasking.</p>    <p>It definitely doesn"t sound like Ra"s" voice (Liam Neeson), though, which could"ve made plausible sense (plot-wise) as a foreshadowing or reminder of Ra"s" "eternal" nature. Although this voice change could similarly be alluding or foreshadowing to a wider scale of the League of Shadows as a whole (if intentional, of course).</p>    <p>Any ideas?</p>    <p>EDIT:</p>    <p>After rereading and rewatching the scene, it"s now my opinion that the voice change here very likely <em>is</em> intentional, whether in a "conscious" or "subconscious" theatrical vein. </p>    <p>I lean toward it being a subtle, subconscious form of directorial foreshadowing, where it"s not intended for the audience to be consciously aware of or focused on it -- much like the similar "subconscious" foreshadowing of when we first see Miranda and Bruce meet (at the charity ball) -- </p>    <p>Miranda enters the scene covering her face with a masquerade mask (alluding/foreshadowing her deception as "Talia"), as Bruce asks her, "Miss Tate, ...isn"t it?"

But they cut it off when it comes to the black background and white text credits roll, either by editing it to skip to the end, or just abruptly ending it.</p>    <p>I can understand that most people ignore credits anyway, and they"re cutting it off to save time (although personally I sometimes like listening to the credits music). However, I wanted to know, is it legal? From my point of view, everybody who worked on the film has a right to have their name shown at the end, and whether they"re acknowledged by the viewer or not should be the viewer"s choice.</p>    <p>Also, now that I think about it, the cinema a go to occasionally also cuts off the credits in the same way.

They only attack military targets, either when provoked or when it"s necessary to further their objective.</li>  <li>The camera is very quick to cut away when it appears that a defenceless target is being attacked, meaning the audience never gets to see what happened.</li>  <li>Every violent act committed by the aliens is in response to aggression from the humans. (In response to a comment, I"ll concede that firing into traffic at Pearl Harbor is a hostile act. However, by the time this happens, the humans have already escalated hostilities, so it"s not like it was completely unprovoked).</li>  <li>The protagonist constantly makes mistakes and escalates hostilities at every opportunity. He actually botches the entire first contact mission, starts a war, gets huge numbers of innocent people killed, and also kills all of the aliens. At the end he is lauded as a hero despite all this.

Whether you watched them because they are the same story, or you found that out afterwards... or you just liked them independently, you would have noticed that although they <em>are</em> the same story, there are details that are different between them.  Now, Walter Hill directed a Bruce Willis film called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Man_Standing_%28film%29" rel="nofollow">Last Man Standing</a>, which is also the same story as those other two.  There are specific nods to both previous versions.  Nods such as...</p>    <p>Bruce stops and spins a bottle when he hits a fork in the road, to determine which way he is going to go.  This is a variant on how Toshiro Mifune throws a stick in the air to decide which way he is going to go when he hits a fork in the road in the beginning of Yojimbo.  Clint Eastwood faces no random chance/indecision and performs no action to choose the way he is going to go before he gets to the town where all the action happens.  So, the Nod is in Last Man Standing, to Yojimbo.</p>    <p>Bruce faces thugs when he arrives who assault his car.  Clint Eastwood faces thugs who harass his mule.  In Yojimbo, Toshiro Mifune is on foot, so the Nod is from Last Man Standing, to Fist Full of Dollars.</p>    <p>After being captured, Clint is assisted in his escape by being hauled off in a coffin.  In Yojimbo, Toshiro escapes the same way at the same point in the story.  Bruce however, is taken away in a car.  So this Nod is in Fist Full of Dollars, to Yojimbo.</p>    <p>I"ve never seen The Glass Key, but all three of these movies are based on it.  One of the differences between it and all the others though, is that Alan Ladd who plays the character playing both sides against each other, is actually loyal to Brian Donlevy... while in the later three films, the protagonist is loyal to neither side.

Now I also see that most questions were answered, even though some questions are still left for debate.</p>    <p>One question that I do wish the producers had given a more satisfactory answer to, though, is the connection between Eloise Hawking and MIB"s loophole.  When Locke leaves the island, he is told by Christian Shephard (i.e. MIB), to find Eloise Hawking in Los Angeles.  Eloise is then later paramount in ensuring that the loophole works in that she is insisting that the coffin with Locke"s body must be on board the Ajira-flight, thus providing MIB with his "vessel" for completing the loophole.  These two facts made me think that perhaps Eloise somehow was cooperating with MIB, but this is never really confirmed, and since we know that MIB can not leave the island, this means that MIB must have "recruited" Eloise before she left the island. But if this is the case, how could MIB know about his loophole-plan years before it manifested?  Does MIB perhaps have contact with somebody else off the island who could relay information to Eloise?  Or is it perhaps possible that Eloise really had no contact with MIB, and simply insisted Locke"s body had to be on the Ajira-flight in order to have a "substitue" for Christian Shephard"s body which was on Oceanic 815?  Or was she somehow manipulated by MIB without her knowledge through some way never seen on the show?  </p>    <p>I really do not find a satisfactory answer to this, so I would love to hear some theories from other people here!  </p>', 350, 692, '2013-08-14 17:38:35.507', '2013-08-14 17:38:35.507', N'Eloise Hawking"s connection to MIB and the loophole', N'<plot-explanation><lost>', '2013-09-28 12:21:55.067'),

I love to tweak and customize my system, and have taught myself a bit of scripting but I am DEFINITELY not a programmer by any means.  I enjoy finding ways to "improve" my system, and then coming to sites like Ask Ubuntu so I may learn how to fix it when my "improvements" break it.
